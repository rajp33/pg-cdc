# pg-cdc

pg-cdc streams row changes for the tables in one Postgres publication through a logical replication slot to a sink. Delivery is at least once, and pg-cdc never writes to the source database.

Status: milestone 1 of the [design](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-14-pg-cdc-design.md). Changes stream to stdout as JSON lines, and the slot is acknowledged after each transaction is written.

## Run

Create the publication and slot first (pg-cdc never creates or drops either):

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION pgcdc_orders FOR TABLE public.orders;
ALTER TABLE public.orders REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('pgcdc_orders', 'pgoutput');
```

Then write a config file and run:

```yaml
pipeline: orders
source:
  host: db.internal
  database: app
  user: pgcdc
  credentials:
    type: password
  tls:
    mode: verify-full
  slot: pgcdc_orders
  publication: pgcdc_orders
sink:
  type: stdout
```

```sh
PGCDC__SOURCE__CREDENTIALS__PASSWORD=... pg-cdc run --config pg-cdc.yaml
```

Each change is one JSON line on stdout; logs are JSON on stderr. Any key can be overridden with `PGCDC__<SECTION>__<KEY>`, and passwords come only from the environment. For Aurora with RDS IAM auth, use `credentials: { type: aws_rds_iam }` with the default AWS credential chain. pg-cdc runs on Linux and macOS.

## Develop

```sh
mise trust && mise install
mise run check
```

`mise run check` is the only gate. Integration tests need Docker; `PGCDC_TEST_PG_VERSION` selects Postgres 14 to 18 (default 17). See [docs/engineering.md](docs/engineering.md).
